> Introducing more of the standard library
>
> *Audience level: Novice*

### Abstract

For novice Python users who want to learn about some of the helpful modules that come in the python standard library. In particular we will talk about `pathlib`, `datetime`, `collections`, `itertools`, and `functools`! Please come with Jupyter Notebook installed.

If you're using conda do "conda install jupyter".

### Description

Python comes with many standard library packages included without any "pip install"! In this beginners tutorial we will go through a few of these with some interactive challenges during the session. Specifically we will dive into `pathlib`, `datetime`, `collections`, `itertools` and `functools` and how these can help you.

You should come away understanding the key features of each of these packages and how to use them in you next project.

Please come with Jupyter Notebook installed. If you're using conda do `conda install jupyter`.
